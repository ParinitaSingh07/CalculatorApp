🧮 Project on Calculator Application using Method Overloading

A simple Calculator Application written in Java that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.It demonstrates the use of Java OOP concepts like Method Overloading, Exception Handling, and Polymorphism along with control structures and user input handling.

📌 Features

Perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division Supports Method Overloading for different parameter types (int, double) and multiple arguments Handles division by zero with proper exception handling Includes an interactive menu-driven interface Provides clear and modular code structure for learning OOP in Java

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Java IDE: VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse

Concepts Used:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Method Overloading (Polymorphism) Exception Handling (try-catch-finally) Scanner for Input Control Structures (Loops, Switch-Case)
